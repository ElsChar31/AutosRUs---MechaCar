# AutosRUs---MechaCar
R and Statistics
Deliverable 4 Instructions
Using your knowledge of R, design a statistical study to compare performance of the MechaCar vehicles against performance of vehicles from other manufacturers.

Follow the instructions below to complete Deliverable 4.

In your README, create a subheading ## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition.
Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
In your description, address the following questions:
If this analyst must construct a compare-and-contrast protocol between the MechaCar and the competition, then the same metrics (coefficients, t-tests and null hypotheses assessments) must be implemented.
What metric or metrics are you going to test? 
In addition to the metrics tested in this module, this analyst would evaluate voltage and electrical outputs.. Irrespective of the combustible-engine quality in either vehicle, the MechaCar and its competitors require batteries and alternators to contribute to their respective efficiencies.
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
The null hypothesis would be that there is no comparable difference between the two automobiles.
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why? 
This analyst would use the two-paired t-test. This is necessary given that this assessment would be a compare-and-contrast evaluation.
What data is needed to run the statistical test? 
This analyst would require the battery and alternator specifications; measurements of the two vehicles' electrical outputs within the 5 to 65 mph or kmh range.
